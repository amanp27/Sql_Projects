# Sql_Projects (Laptop Data Analysis and Cleaning )

💻 Laptop Data Analysis and Cleaning
This project involves a thorough process of data cleaning 🧼 and exploratory data analysis (EDA) 📊 on a dataset of laptop specifications. The goal is to refine the dataset for deeper insights and prepare it for machine learning and analytical tasks.

🔍 Key Steps and Objectives
Data Cleaning 🧹:

Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
Standardized formats across columns (e.g., extracted CPU speeds, removed units from memory values, and reformatted GPU details).
Resolved inconsistencies in categorical data (like brand names) for better accuracy.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📉:

Conducted descriptive statistics and visualized distributions of price, RAM, and CPU speeds.
Analyzed relationships between key features, like price vs. specifications and brand comparisons.
Detected potential outliers using IQR and Z-score methods to maintain data quality.

📂 Project Structure
SQL Queries 📝: SQL scripts for data cleaning and transformation.
Visualizations 📊: Graphs and plots from the EDA process.
Documentation 🗒️: Step-by-step notes explaining each data cleaning and analysis step.

🎯 Goals
By the end, this analysis provides a clean and structured dataset with insights into laptop specs, brand pricing trends, and key performance metrics.
