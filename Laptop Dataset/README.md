üíª Laptop Data Analysis ‚Äì Data Cleaning, Case Study & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Overview:

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a Laptop Dataset, covering a wide range of product features, specifications, and prices. The objective was to clean the data, analyze trends, and generate insights relevant to consumers and retailers. With a focus on improving data quality and conducting meaningful analysis, this project provides a complete breakdown of the laptop market.

üìÇ Dataset Information:
Columns:
* Key features including Brand, Processor, RAM, Storage, GPU, Inches, Weight, Price, and Ratings.
* Core Focus: Refining and analyzing specifications data to identify pricing trends, brand comparisons, and performance metrics.

üéØ Project Goals:
* Data Cleaning: Remove inconsistencies, standardize formats, and address null values for an accurate dataset.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify pricing patterns, brand popularity, and other factors affecting consumer choices.
* Case Study Insights: Address practical questions around the best specifications for various budget ranges, and analyze the price-performance trade-off.

üìä Key Findings:
* Price Patterns: Price trends were identified across brands and specific specifications, helping to show value for money.
* Brand Performance: Different brands showed unique strengths in categories such as processing power, storage capacity, and build quality.
* Display Size & Resolution: A strong correlation was found between display size and price, with premium models typically offering larger screens.

‚öôÔ∏è Challenges Faced:
1. Data Type Adjustments: Some numeric fields like RAM, Inches, and Price contained non-standard characters and required conversion to the correct data types for effective analysis.
2. Column Redundancy: Fields like Product ID and Brand repetitions led to duplicate insights, requiring a more focused approach on key columns.
3. Incomplete Data: Missing values in Ratings and GPU data posed challenges for accurate analysis, requiring careful imputation methods.

üìà Project Results:

After cleaning and analyzing the dataset, we produced detailed insights that highlight consumer preferences, brand positioning, and specification-based pricing. This dataset provides a solid basis for exploring the relationship between product specifications and consumer choices.
